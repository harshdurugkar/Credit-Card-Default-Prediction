1) As we know in today’s times, credit cards have huge risks behind the high returns of banks. The increasing number of credit card users is all about an increase in the number of credit card defaults and that’s why the result is amounts of bills & repayment information data have chances to create a risk.
2) The Credit card default prediction is based on the data of all credit card customers. The method which we use to predict and analyze credit card customer default behavior is a typical classification problem.
3) According to the Federal Reserve economic data, the default rate on credit loans across all commercial banks is at an all-time high for the past 66 months and it is likely to continue to climb throughout 2020. 
4) That’s why, banks must have a risk prediction model and be able to classify the most relative characteristics that are indicative of people who have a higher probability of default on credit.
5) The main purpose is to build a model  that allows us to effectively combine static and dynamic features to provide superior predictive performance for financial data.
